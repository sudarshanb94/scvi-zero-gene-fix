# TOML configuration file for scVI training
# 
# IMPORTANT: The path below should point to a DIRECTORY containing your h5ad files.
# The code will automatically find and load ALL .h5 and .h5ad files in that directory.
# 
# Example: If your data is sharded like:
#   /data/my_experiment/
#     ├── shard_001.h5ad
#     ├── shard_002.h5ad
#     ├── shard_003.h5ad
#     └── ...
# 
# Then set: my_dataset = "/data/my_experiment/"
# 
# The code will automatically load all shard_*.h5ad files!

[datasets]
# Replace this with your actual data directory path
# The directory should contain your sharded .h5ad files
my_dataset = "/path/to/your/data/directory/"

[training]
# Specify which dataset to use for training (set to "train")
my_dataset = "train"

# Optional: Zero-shot evaluation tasks (leave empty if not using)
[zeroshot]

# Optional: Few-shot evaluation tasks (leave empty if not using)
[fewshot]

# Example few-shot configuration (uncomment and modify if needed):
# [fewshot."my_dataset.cell_type_name"]
# val = ['perturbation1', 'perturbation2', 'perturbation3']
# test = ['perturbation4', 'perturbation5', 'perturbation6']
